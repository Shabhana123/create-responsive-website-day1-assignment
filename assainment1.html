        <h1>CORONA VIRUS</h1>
        <P><b><u><i>INFORMATION:</i></u></b></P>
            <p1>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. <br> Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. </b></p1>
            <p><b><u><i>GLOBAL RESERCH DATABASE:</i></u></b></p>
            <P2>WHO is gathering the latest international multilingual scientific findings and knowledge on COVID-19. <br>The global literature cited in the WHO COVID-19 database is updated daily (Monday through Friday) from searches of bibliographic databases, hand searching, <br>and the addition of other expert-referred scientific articles.This database represents a comprehensive multilingual source of current literature on the topic.<br> While it may not be exhaustive, new research is added regularly.<br></P2>
            <p><b><u><i>DESCLAIMER:</i></u></b></p>
            <p3>the designations employed and the presentation of the material in publications listed in this database does not imply the expression of any opinion<br> whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation<br> of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.<br></p3>
            <p><u><i><b>PRECAUTIONS:</b></i></u></p>
            <p4>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.<br> Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face<br>.
            For much of the past year, life in Western Australia has been coronavirus-free. Friends gathered in pubs; people kissed and hugged their relatives; <br>children went to school without temperature checks or wearing masks. The state maintained this enviable position only by placing heavy restrictions on travel and imposing lockdowns<br> — some regions entered a snap lockdown at the beginning of the year after a security guard at a hotel where visitors were quarantined tested positive for the virus.<br> But the experience in Western Australia has provided a glimpse into a life free from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. If other regions, aided by vaccines, aimed for a similar<br> zero-COVID strategy, then could the world hope to rid itself of the virus?<br></p4>
